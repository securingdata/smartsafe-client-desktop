	<h1>Search engine</h1>
	<p>
		In order to easily find your Entries without having to navigate into all your Groups, a search engine is available 
		through the keystroke 'Ctrl-F' or by clicking in the search field present at the right top of the window.
	</p>
	<p>
		The search is performed dynamically as soon as a character is typed into the search field. Pressing 'Enter' will select the first 
		Entry found.
	</p>
	<p>
		The search is based on the content of 'Identifier' and 'User name' values of each Entry. The search algorithm is split in two parts:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Entries that contain the exact sequence provided in the search field are first displayed.
				The algorithm is not case sensitive.
				The display order is based on the Group order and the Entry order in the Group.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the search field contains at least three characters, then a second search is performed taking in account that
				user may have performed a typo error when providing the search text. Entries found by this method are displayed after
				Entries that have been found to perfectly match with the provided search text. The display order is the same as the one
				described for the first part.
			</li>
		</ul>
