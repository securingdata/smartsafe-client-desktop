	<h1>Creating a Group</h1>
	<p>This action is available through the menu entry 'File' &rarr; 'New Group'.</p>
	<p>
		As for creating a folder, creating a Group requires only to give it a name.
		An error may be displayed on Group creation (for instance when there is no more memory available on the token).
