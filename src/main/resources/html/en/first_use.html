		When using the token for the first time or after a token update, user must update the password. Indeed, by default, the password value

		the default password. Then, select the menu entry 'File' &rarr; 'Change Password'.

		An icon, on the right side of fields indicates if the input data is correct or not. A tooltip text is also present in case of error 
		in order to advise the user.
		
		Here is the list of the checks performed in this dialog window:
		<ul>
			<li>Password cannot be empty</li>
			<li>Both entered passwords must be obviously identical</li>
			<li>Password must contain at least 8 characters</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		It is advised to regularly modify the password. For an optimal security, it is recommended to use a minimal password length of 16 characters,
		using uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.
