	<h1>Actions on Groups and Entries</h1>
	<p>
		When an Entry is selected, a set of actions that can be performed is available through the menu entry 'Edit' our through the context menu:
		<ul>
			<li>the Entry can be edited,</li>
			<li>the URL can be browsed in the default web navigator,</li>
			<li>the user name or the password can be copied to the clipboard,</li>
			<li>finally, the password can be showed to the user.</li>
		</ul>
		In this last case, for security reasons, selecting another Entry will hide the previously shown password.
	</p>
	<p>
		The display order of Groups and Entries can be modified through the context menu entries 'Up' and 'Down'.
		<br>
		An Entry can also be transferred in another Group through the context menu entry 'Move to ...'.
	</p>
	<p>
		When triggering the 'Delete' action, two behaviors can happen:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div>If no Entry is selected, the only proposed action is to delete the currently selected Group.</div>

			</li>
			<li>
				<div>
					If an Entry is selected, user has to choose between deleting only the currently selected Entry or deleting the currently
					selected Group.
				</div>
