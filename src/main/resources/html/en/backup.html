	<h1>Backup or restore data</h1>
	<p>
		Doing backup is strongly recommended. Backup allow to recover your data when (for instance) you lose or break your token.
		A backup file can be used on an empty token only.
		When selecting the menu entry 'Backup', two reactions are possible (the difference can be seen on the validation button):
		<ul>
			<li>If there is at least one Group created into the token, the 'Backup' window is opened.</li>
			<li>If there is no Group created into the token, the 'Restore' window is opened.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		Select the location where the backup will be done and provide a password that will be used to cipher the backup file.
		After clicking on 'Backup from token' button, a progress window will be showed until backup process ends. If any error occurs during
		backup, it will be shown into the progress bar and the progress window will not be automatically closed. Otherwise, the progress
		window closes itself automatically at the end of the process.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Restoring data</h2>
	<img src="static/backup1.png">
	<p>
		Select the location from where the backup will be read and provide a password that will be used to decipher the backup file.
		After clicking on 'Restore token' button, a progress window will be showed until restore process ends. If any error occurs during
		restoration, it will be shown into the progress bar and the progress window will not be automatically closed. Otherwise, the progress
		window closes itself automatically at the end of the process.
